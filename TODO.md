# TODO

- Cleanup and read-through
- Update documentation
- Update deployment.sh script
- Check authorization behavior so it matches Gitmetrix
- CW metrics

## Roadmap/later

- Create test data
- Add more tests
- Higher type coverage
- Make sure authorizer checks product/repo name so they can only affect their own org
- The time format 'DD:HH:MM:SS' is logically limited to 99 days - is this a real problem?
